					    ----> project A
	index ---> home --------> project B
						----> project C

	At index, the user will be presented with either logging in or creating an account on the index page. Account creation is public and open. Once a user has created an account, they can log into the home page. Here they will be presented with a list of projects they are a member of, and the rest of the projects that they can request an invite for. This will not be an exhaustive list of all work in progress projects - only ones that are generally available. Admin users will have the exhaustive list and are automatically a member of every project.


	*******************************
	*    Project Invite System    *
	*******************************

	> A user requests access to a project - requestInvite url
	> I get an email requesting access. It has a link to send the invite - sendInvite url
	> The user gets an email with a link to accept invite - acceptInvite url

	I get an email. It has a link to a generateInvite url

	This generateInvite controller returns no page. It just generates a token. Stores it in the DB with a DateCreated entry. It then also emails the requester

	This email contains a link with ..../acceptInvite?token=abcdefg

	They can now create a user account. If the token is in the DB and matches the useremail, the creation will be successful. Otherwise it will fail.

	Tokens will be deleted from the db if no account has been created with it within 24hrs (DELETE FROM table WHERE date < '2011-09-21 08:21:22';)
