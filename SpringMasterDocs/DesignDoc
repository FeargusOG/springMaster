Design Doc for SpringMaster

I get an email. It has a link to a generateInvite url

This generateInvite controller returns no page. It just generates a token. Stores it in the DB with a DateCreated entry. It then also emails the requester

This email contains a link with ..../acceptInvite?token=abcdefg

They can now create a user account. If the token is in the DB and matches the useremail, the creation will be successful. Otherwise it will fail.

Tokens will be deleted from the db if no account has been created with it within 24hrs (DELETE FROM table WHERE date < '2011-09-21 08:21:22';)

Possible table layout:

	Token Table:
		Token
		UserEmail
		Date Created

	User Table:
		UserId
		Email
		Password (Hashed)
		Date Created
		Enabled

	ProjectTable
		UsersAllowed
