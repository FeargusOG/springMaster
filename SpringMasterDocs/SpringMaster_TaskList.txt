Task List:
	> I changed the tables locally, but not in Heroku!! Also, didn't add back in a user role or invite table.
	> I need to get the CustomUserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername to load the user fully. Have utils load the user, and this calls that.
		> Still need to load the GrantedAuth
	> I need transactionality for operations.... if I don't add a user role for a user, I want to rollback the account creation...
		> http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring/4.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html
	> Remove junk from github for this project
	> Add in error pages....
	> Add in Unit Tests
	> Autowire the DataSource and Logging
	> Add some basic UI
	> Move script to correct place in accountCreation.html file
	> We possibly need to add permitAll() to all css, javascript, image files etc.

Bugs:
	> The boxes in accountcreation stay highlighted red, even if you fix them and some other one causes a problem.
	

Captain's Log:
	> 30/04/16 (Shrewsbury)
		> Added the MvcConfig class so I had a ctrl for login.html (wasn't sure what my own ctrl should look like, with redirects etc. Might change this at some point.)
		> Added the hidden csrf token field to the login form.
		> Pushed these changed to feargus.org as a new master.

	> 2/05/16 (Starbucks, Waterloo Road)
		> Added a 403 cntrlr and page
		> Added a lot of code for performing custom jdbc authentication. Overall, it went well but supplying your own salt to the DaoAuthenticationProvider PasswordEncoder is now deprecated. However, I decided to use the deprecated version so that I can continue to use my custom salt.
		> Added lowerCase conversion when taking in user emails (so lowercase is stored in db).

	> 21/05/16 (Starbucks, Waterloo Road)
		> Got the user acc creation form and backend working with the new CustomUserDetails class
